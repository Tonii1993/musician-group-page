            <h3>Career</h3>
            The band formed in 1988 in the town of Tetovo, SR Macedonia,
            although their first recording was published as an album titled Elita 5 in 1990.
            They have repeatedly refused to play in competitive festivals stating that
            "the band does not belong in festivals", preferring concerts instead.
            In a 2001 concert, the band had opened in Tirana,
            Albania for the German heavy metal band Scorpions,
            the vocalist Arif Ziberi in an interview noted that this was one of the most exciting moments in his life.
            In 2008 the band organised a humanitarian concert in Tetovo,
            Macedonia for the victims of the 2008 Gërdec explosions.
            They take part in many concerts and are annually invited to close the Beer fest in the city of Korçë, Albania.
